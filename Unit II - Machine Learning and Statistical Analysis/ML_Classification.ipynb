Particularly, we want to know what fraction of all positive predictions were correct and what fraction of positive observations did we identify. The two metrics that describe these values are precision and recall. Precision is the fraction of true positives over all positive predictions. It is a measure of how \"precise\" our model was with regards to labeling observations as positive. Recall, on the other hand, is equal to the fraction of true positives over all positive observations. It is a measure of our model's ability to \"catch\" and properly label observations that are positive.\n",

For example, it might predict that there's a 75% chance the observation is positive. For the preceding example, should we assign a positive or negative label? The natural choice is to assign the observation as positive since the predicted probability is greater than 50%. However, we don't have to stick to 50%; we can adjust our **threshold** and only classify observations as positive if our models predicts a greater than 90% probability. By increasing the threshold, we will make our model only make positive predictions when it is very certain and confident. Conversely, if we lower our threshold, our model will more liberally assign positive labels. Adjusting threshold affects the models precision and recall. \n",

It measures not only whether the model will correctly classify an observation but rewards the model if it's confidence of a correct prediction is high.

For example, a model will have a lower log loss if it predicts a probability of 95% for an observation of class 1 than if it had predicted 60%. Thus, it is possible for two models to have the same accuracy yet have different log loss. Despite being slightly harder to interpret, it reveals more information of a model's performance than accuracy.
