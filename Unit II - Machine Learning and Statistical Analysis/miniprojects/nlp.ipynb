    "\n",
    "The objective of this miniproject is to gain experience with natural language processing and how to use text data to train a machine learning model to make predictions. For the miniproject, we will be working with product review text from Amazon. The reviews are for only products in the \"Electronics\" category. The objective is to train a model to predict the rating, ranging from 1 to 5 stars.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scoring\n",
    "\n",
    "For most of the questions, you will be asked to submit the `predict` method of your trained model to the grader. The grader will use the passed `predict` method to evaluate how your model performs on a test set with respect to a reference model. The grader uses the [R<sup>2</sup>-score](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/model_evaluation.html#r2-score) for model evaluation. If your model performs better than the reference solution, then you can score higher than 1.0. For the last question, you will submit the result of an analysis and your passed answer will be compared directly to the reference solution.\n",

    "## Downloading and loading the data\n",
    "\n",
    "The data set is available on Amazon S3 and comes as a compressed file where each line is a JSON object. To load the data set, we will need to use the `gzip` library to open the file and decode each JSON into a Python dictionary. In the end, we have a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents an observation."

    "Topic modeling is the analysis of determining the key topics or themes in a corpus. With respect to machine learning, topic modeling is an unsupervised technique. One way to uncover the main topics in a corpus is to use [non-negative matrix factorization](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.NMF.html). For this question, use non-negative matrix factorization to determine the top ten words for the first twenty topics. You should submit your answer as a list of lists.
