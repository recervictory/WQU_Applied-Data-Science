For example, we might use supervised machine learning to transcribe spoken language to text, predict home values based on neighborhood amenities, or detect fraudulent transactions. In order to assess whether our model is succeeding, we need to formally define what success is for the given task. In this notebook, we will explore several common **metrics** for model performance."
